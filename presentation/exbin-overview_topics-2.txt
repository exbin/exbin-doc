What is ExBin:
- Unified architecture to represent and process data in extensible binary tree structure

- Representation of data with focus on binary and extensible
- General binary data format/protocol + catalog of definitions + related tools
- 

Why is it done?
- Text formats can't handle complex data properly (images, audio/video, compression, encryption)
- Syntax preference depends on taste and best fitness for particular use case
- Language is not precise enough
- Text is typically limited to single language
- Typical binary formats has often fixed structure and it's hard to identify content of the file

How is it done?
- Minimalist approach
- Tree of blobs data structure
- Definition of evolvable abstract concepts
- Development by multiple teams
- Isolated interfaces

What is done?
- Data storage and comm protocol
- Catalog of definitions
- Transformation framework
- Programming and scripting language
