Welcome to overview presentation about the ExBin project.

== What It Is

ExBin project is an non-commercial initiative to bring evolution in general data storing and processing by providing set of unified methods to access and convert any structured data. 

Name of the project reflects two basic aspects this project:

== Why Binary?

* Support for complex data structures
* Can handle compressed / multimedia data
* Deep type definition
* Can use syntax / language of your choice

== Why Extensible?

* Enables evolution
* Adaptable to new use case
* 3rd parties can colaborate

== Why Bother at All?

* Better structured and documented binary data
* Machine processable binary data
* Bring advantages of mark-up languages to binary world
* More flexibility

== Technology Steps

* Universal Data Protocol
* Data Processing Framework
* Programming Language
* Database System
* Mesh Repository

== Universal Data Protocol

Multilayer architecture
Unified block-tree structure
Build-in and custom data types
Data operations
Catalogs of definitions
Support for automatic conversion / compatibility handling

== Data Processing Framework

Library or OS service
Local or remote method calls
Combine multiple operations into complex ones
Computation / execution nodes
On-demand and automatic data conversion

== Programming Language

Primary data-flow paradigm
Stored using protocol
Multiple / evolving syntaxes possible
Conversion and refactoring transformations
Low and high level programming

== Database System

Focused on binary data first
Using protocol for storage and queries
Configurable / optionally relational
Integrated transformation framework

== Mesh Repository

Data sources and computation services
Knowledge base
Internet services
Metadata and ontology definitions

== Tools

Protocol parsing and service API libraries
Protocol data editor
Data type catalog editor
Transformation framework management
Mesh browser
Example and demo applications
